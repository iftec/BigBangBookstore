# **Models & Schema**
### **Database**
* For the implementation of the Bookstore Application, I required the use of a database to store both the user information, orders and books
* For the database I have opted to use Postgres
* Below is a list of relations of the database models used in this application.
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/iftec/recipe-book/blob/main/documentation/DB_Schema.png?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/iftec/recipe-book/blob/main/documentation//DB_Schema.png?raw=true" alt="layouts" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>

* Once the user has registered on the site, their sign-up information is stored along with a unique ID in the database.
* Everytime the user creates an order, this unique ID is stored with that order in a separate 'orders' table.

* A user has the ability to create an account, once the required text has been entered into the entry form click the 'submit' button and the account will be added to the database.

#### ** Login/ Logout**

#### **Update user password**
* The user has the option to update their password by clicking on the Update Password button in their account section.


#### **Delete account**
